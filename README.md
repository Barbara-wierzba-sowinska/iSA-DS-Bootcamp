## DL Project - Judge an album by it's cover.

I was responsible for building the resnet model and drawing conclusions based on it's performance.   

Conspect:
- Aim: can a deep learning model be effective in recognizing a music genre (rap, electro) by an album cover?
- Building a resnet model and applying transfer learning.
- Model's accuracy was ca. 70%.
- Further development: extending the model's capability by additional music genres, better optimalization.
